        <h1 style="font-family: Georgia;"><i><b>HOW THE THREE-POINT BALL CHANGED COLLEGE BASKETBALL</b></i></h1>

        <h4 style="font-family: Georgia"><i><b>By Adam Campos</b></i></h4>


        <p style="font-family: Georgia">
          The game of basketball over this last decade has seen a transformation unlike any previous eras. This era introduced the three-point ball. While basketball has seen the influences of players like Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, and Allen Iverson, their impacts on the game created individual change for players. The three-point revolution in basketball, ignited by current NBA player Stephen Curry, created an entirely new style of play all together. 
        </p>

        <p style="font-family: Georgia">
          It’s trickled down from the professional level all the way to youth basketball. Teams’ plays are designed for a fast-paced game, and are structured for the opportunity to create as many open three’s as possible. 
        </p>

        <p style="font-family: Georgia">
          Poor shooting teams are automatically targeted for their inability to shoot, and it typically makes it easier for defenses to adapt. Great shooting teams however, are the teams from hell for defenses. 
        </p>

        <p style="font-family: Georgia">
          Whether the good shooting team has the athletic ability to attack the rim or not, their shooting is able to keep them close in any game by simply creating the openings needed. 
        </p>

        <p style="font-family: Georgia">
          As the game has changed, each level of play has had to adapt to the new style. For the NBA, this adjustment was nothing major; it’s the college game that for a second, took a hit with the quality of play. The adjustment to the three-point game went as far as extending the three-point line in college basketball. Instead of the normal 20 ft 9 in three point line, it was extended to the international distance of 22 ft, 1 ¾ in; close to a two foot difference. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <caption><i>VIA NCAA</i></caption>

        <br>

        <p style="font-family: Georgia">
        Since the game was moving in the direction of the three-point shot being the dominant weapon in the pro game, the purpose of the move was to allow college players to adapt to the three-point line’s distance at the professional level.
        </p>

        <p style="font-family: Georgia">
          “The move challenged our guys at first. It forced them to put more into their shot with their mechanics especially for how much of a difference the two feet made.” University of Redlands Assistant Coach Dominic Lippi says. 
        </p>

        <p style="font-family: Georgia">
          Prior to joining the University of Redlands as an assistant coach, Lippi spent three years at the Division 1 level as the Director of Basketball Operations at Saint Mary’s College. He noted that not only was the three point line a change for the players individually, but it was also somewhat of an adjustment for the team as one. 
        </p>

        <p style="font-family: Georgia">
          “Our offensive and defensive habits changed,” Lippi says, “It forced our players to become more disciplined on both ends of the floor. They needed to cover more ground to get out to shooters on defense, and on offense, it forced us to spread the floor more to execute our sets.” 
        </p>

        <p style="font-family: Georgia">
          It was clear when games started how much this change was affecting teams. Nationally and across all levels of college basketball, field goal percentages and three-point field goal percentages both dropped. 
        </p>

       <iframe title="College Basketball 3PT Percentage" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-pvvuP" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pvvuP/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="279"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

       <p style="font-family: Georgia">
        With this drop between the two seasons, the 2019-2020 seasons was the year the three ball was least effective. Coming in at around 33.4 percent, the 2020 season was the worst three point shooting year since college basketball introduced the three point line. It's also the lowest from the last decade, where the three point shot was used more than ever before. 

        <iframe title="NCAA 3PT Percentage in 2010s" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-lyeV5" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lyeV5/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="332"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

        <p style="font-family: Georgia">
          For the players, it at first did not feel like a major change since many players would pull up from a few feet behind the three point line already. However, once the new line was implemented, the change was mostly felt during the game. 
        </p>

        <p style="font-family: Georgia">
          For many college players, they were already adapted to the 20 foot length, especially having played anywhere from one to three years at that distance. Fifth-year Pepperdine Guard Jadè Smith was one of those players who played multiple years of college ball prior to the change. 
        </p>

        <p style="font-family: Georgia">
          “Subconsciously you already have an idea of where you’re at on the court when you’re spotting up for a shot,” says Smith. “With the new three-point line, there’s been a lot of times where we’d spot up, and instead of a three, we’re shooting a long two.” 
        </p>

        <p style="font-family: Georgia">
        Even with the change in the three-point line’s distance, the number of threes actually taken in games are still high. Coach Lippi notes that the game has simply changed for good because of the three point revolution. 
       </p>

       <p style="font-family: Georgia">
         “Our game isn’t going to change because of the line being pushed back,” Lippi emphasizes. “The game itself has already gone through a revolution of change just in this last decade because of the three point ball. So just because the line was moved back two feet doesn’t mean less threes are going to go up. It’s just the way the game of basketball is played now.” 
       </p>

       <p style="font-family: Georgia">
         College basketball took somewhat of a hit in its performances because of the three-point line being pushed back, but players quickly adjusted to the move in the seasons following the change. As players became accustomed to the distance, the overall team performance took a stride. The attempts are still high, and now the makes are back to the norms. 
       </p>

       <p style="font-family: Georgia">
        The game is going to continue to evolve as the years go by. Players are going to become more athletic, more skilled, more crafty, and who knows what else more players can become. 
      </p>

      <P style="font-family: Georgia"> As long as this three point revolution continues, players are only going to continue shooting the ball from a deep distance. A stepback three pointer is no longer considered a bad shot; neither is a three pointer from three feet behind the arc. 
      </P>

      <P style="font-family: Georgia">
        While we shouldn’t expect a drastic change to the floor again anytime soon, we can see college basketball is changing like every other level of basketball because of the three point shot.
      </P>
